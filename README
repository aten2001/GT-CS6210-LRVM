Log files are used to records the modification of the memory segments instead of directly modifying the memory.

Log File Format
|TB|# of Records|Segname1|offset1|length1|mem1|Segname2|offset2|...|TE|
|TB|# of Records|Segname1|offset1|length1|mem1|TE|

We truncate the redo log during several circumstances.
1. During rvm_map. Once we detected that segname unmapped and modified by previous transaction, we call rvm_truncate_log to update segment.
2. During rvm_commit. Once we detected that the log file is too big (>1M), we call rvm_truncate_log to clean up the log file.
3. During rvm_init. We do a rvm_truncate_log when we initialize the rvm.
